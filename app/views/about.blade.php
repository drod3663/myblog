			Pretty much sums me up. I have a wide range of interests from movies, music, sports, learning, tv shows, books, food and 
			traveling. I could go on and on and in depth about my interests but I dont want to bore you. Like I said I'm a man of few
			words and if you have any questions please feel free to ask.
