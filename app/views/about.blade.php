		<h1>I'm a man of few words....any questions?</h1>
	
	<p>
		<h3>
			Pretty much sums me up. I have a wide range of interests from movies, music, sports, learning, tv shows, books, food and 
			traveling. I got into web development after working for nine years at Chick-fil-A and deciding I needed a new challenge. 
			I could go on and on and about myself but I dont want to bore you. Like I said I'm a man of few
			words and if you have any questions please feel free contact me.
